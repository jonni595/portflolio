            <h3>Education üéì</h3>
            <p>
              I studied at the Pedro Morales Pino school, completing primary and
              secondary school. I obtained my bachelor's degree in 2012. Years
              later, after serving in the military, I began a technological
              career at SENA. Without having any idea what programming was
              about, I set out to study it with great enthusiasm. <br /> <br />
              That's when I had my first introduction to its wonderful world. At
              first, I had difficulty having a clear vision of what it meant to
              be a programmer. There were moments when I felt lost and wondered
              if I had chosen the wrong career. However, everything changed when
              I had my first contacts with the web. My imagination ran wild at
              all the possibilities that developing web applications was
              offering me. I completed my studies in 2017 by presenting my
              degree. <br />
              <br /> The following year, I applied to start my professional
              career as a systems engineer at the Antonio Jose Camacho
              University. Due to personal issues, I had to suspend my studies,
              but I hope to resume and complete this beautiful path that has
              brought me here.

            <h3>Profession üíª</h3>
            <p>
              When I completed my studies, I was unable to find a position in
              the tech market. So, I decided to find a job that would help me
              with my responsibilities. I entered the world of work in a
              customer service company, where I stayed for almost 5 years from
              2017 to 2022. I resigned because I wanted to resume my career in
              tech, and I obtained a position as a junior web developer. <br /><br /> My
              expectations were very high when I obtained my first job in the
              tech world. However, my profile was different from what the
              company was looking for. I resigned with the aim of getting a job
              that matched my skills, and it wasn't until a year later that I
              found a job as a freelancer. I was part of a mobile project where
              we used modern technologies such as React Native and TypeScript. I
              managed to develop different modules for user authentication,
              designs, and navigation between screens.
